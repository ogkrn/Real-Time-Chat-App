# Real-Time-Chat-App

This project is a real-time chat application designed for modern web communication. It is built with Next.js for the frontend, Express with TypeScript for the backend, and Supabase (Postgres) with Prisma ORM for secure and reliable data storage. Real-time communication is powered by Socket.io integrated with Redis, enabling fast message delivery, presence tracking, and scalability across multiple servers. The app includes JWT-based authentication, message persistence, and a responsive UI that allows users to connect instantly. With a modular architecture and production-ready design, the project is future-proof and can be extended with features such as private chats, group channels, file sharing, and push notifications. This makes it suitable for both learning purposes and real-world deployment.
